**Course:** ICT461 - Web Standards and HTTP Fundamentals
**Date:** September 22, 2026

## 🚀 Run Instructions

This project requires Node.js. The architecture is decoupled into a frontend client and a backend API.

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:
   `npm install`

2. **Start the API Server (Backend):**
   Run the following command to start the Express server on port 3000:
   `node server.js`

3. **Start the Interface (Frontend):**
   Serve the `index.html` file using a local web server (such as the VS Code Live Server extension) on port 5500. 
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5500` in your browser.

## 🧠 Decision Note & Concept Explanations

**Architecture:** We strictly decoupled the client and server. The client relies on semantic HTML and vanilla JS with CSS Grid for responsiveness. The server relies on Express for JSON parsing and in-memory storage to satisfy lab constraints without a database. CORS was implemented specifically for `http://127.0.0.1:5500` to secure cross-origin requests.

**Idempotency vs Status Codes:** Idempotency dictates that executing a request multiple times has the exact same net effect on the server's state as executing it once. A `DELETE` request successfully removes a resource (`204`). Repeating it changes nothing further, resulting in a `404`. The ultimate state (resource gone) is identical.

**Accept vs Content-Type:** `Content-Type` describes the format of the data being sent in the request body (e.g., `application/json`). `Accept` indicates what data format the client hopes to receive back.

**Freshness vs Revalidation:** Cache freshness (`max-age=60`) allows the browser to serve stored data without contacting the server, saving bandwidth. Revalidation (`If-None-Match`) occurs once data goes stale; the client sends an ETag to ask if data has been modified, receiving a `304 Not Modified` if unchanged.

**Browser vs cURL CORS:** Web browsers enforce CORS policies to protect users against unauthorized cross-site execution, blocking requests without explicit server permission. cURL is a raw network tool that does not run user scripts or enforce web security policies, executing HTTP requests unconditionally.

## 🌿 Git Workflow & AI Use

**Git Workflow:**
Development was managed via Git. We tracked the API requirements using an issue, created a `feature/api-development` branch, and retained over four meaningful iterative commits covering route creation, validation logic, caching, and CORS implementation. Code was peer-reviewed locally before merging into `main`.

**AI-Use.md:**
AI was utilized as a syntactical reference and diagnostic assistant during this lab (e.g., debugging the Node.js crash caused by a stray character and structuring the Express CORS middleware). All architectural decisions, HTML semantics, and server validations reflect our own understanding of the HTTP standards.

## 👤 Individual Reflections

### Pirila Banda-  202301821
I primarily focused on the backend API development using Express and implemented the CORS middleware to successfully connect the decoupled frontend and backend systems. During testing, I made a mistake with ETag revalidation in Task 3; I mistakenly passed the literal placeholder string `"YOUR_COPIED_ETAG"` in the cURL header instead of the actual generated hash. This caused the server to continuously return a `200 OK` payload instead of the expected `304 Not Modified`. I fixed this by correcting the header syntax in my terminal command, explicitly escaping the quotes around the actual dynamic ETag value (`W/\"...\"`). I verified the fix by re-running the cURL command and successfully capturing the `304` status with an empty body.

### Michelo  Harry Moonga -  202110843
In Task 1, I built an accessible, responsive course registration portal for Mulungushi University using semantic HTML5 (header, nav, main, footer) and CSS Grid/Flexbox. I implemented a structured form with required inputs and linked labels, ensuring full keyboard navigation using Tab and Enter.
A major challenge was preventing horizontal overflow and maintaining visible focus indicators at smaller viewport widths (360 px). To resolve this, I implemented CSS media queries to switch from a multi-column grid to a single-column layout for mobile screens. I also added explicit :focus-visible outline styles to keep controls fully accessible without breaking the responsive layout.
